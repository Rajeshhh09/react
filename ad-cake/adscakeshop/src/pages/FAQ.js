      question: "How far in advance should I order a custom cake?",
      answer: "We recommend ordering custom cakes at least 7 days in advance. For wedding cakes or elaborate designs, 2-3 weeks is preferable."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer gluten-free or vegan options?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer both gluten-free and vegan cake options. Please note these may require additional time to prepare and may have a slight price difference."
    },
    {
      question: "What are your delivery options?",
      answer: "We offer delivery within a 15-mile radius of our bakery for $10. For locations further away, we can arrange delivery through a third-party service. Pickup is always free."
    },
    {
      question: "How should I store my cake?",
      answer: "Cakes should be stored in the refrigerator and brought to room temperature 30 minutes before serving for best taste. Cakes with fresh fruit or cream should be consumed within 2 days."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I make changes to my order after placing it?",
      answer: "Changes can be made up to 48 hours before pickup or delivery. After that, we cannot guarantee modifications."
    },
    {
      question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
      answer: "We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, and cash. For custom cake orders, we require a 50% deposit at the time of ordering."
